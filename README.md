# React Joe Artist Music App

Created by Margarita Sighton.

Description: The page should have the following sections:

- A promotional banner advertising a new single
- A “Music” section (not required to have working audio playback). Can display anything music-related using either of the following APIs (feel free to query any UMG artist)
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
https://www.last.fm/api
- A “Merch” section showcasing 1-4 products (can use dummy/static data)
- A “Video” section that displays the Top 3 Youtube videos by views
- Include an option to filter the product for one of the sections (this option should use a React hook to conditionally call one of the suggested API endpoints).
- The page should be fully responsive on mobile.
- Include pagination or infinite scroll in one of the sections.
- Please include one visualization/graph using any of the API’s previously mentioned
- Code should be reviewable in GitHub.
